            <h3>Welcome to Phinbrew</h3>
            <p>Welcome to Phinbrew, your source for premium Japanese sencha, matcha, Korean Jeoncha, Chinese teas,
                coffee accessories, and traditional incense. Founded by Riley, a lifelong tea enthusiast, Phinbrew was
                born from his love for Japanese tea discovered while serving in Japan and Korea with the U.S. Air Force.
                When Riley began drinking green tea regularly, his life transformed—his skin glowed, his energy soared,
                and his focus sharpened, thanks to sencha’s antioxidants, anti-cancer properties, and benefits for skin
                and gums. Inspired by his mother’s cancer battle, Riley is driven to share green tea’s empowering health
                benefits with you.</p>
            <p>Green tea, especially sencha, brings calmness and clarity, like a martial artist’s focus. Its catechins
                fight free radicals, potentially reducing cancer risk and boosting wellness. At Phinbrew, we craft
                rituals that blend tea and incense to elevate your mind and body.</p>

            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>Riley’s passion for tea ignited in Japan and Korea, where sencha’s grassy notes and Jeoncha’s roasted
                depth captivated him during his USAF service. Living in Brussels, Belgium, as a karate brown belt, he
                found green tea amplified his focus, echoing the discipline of Miyamoto Musashi. Phinbrew blends this
                martial arts-inspired clarity with tea’s health benefits, offering hand-picked teas, accessories, and
                incense to empower your daily rituals.</p>
            <p>Inspired by his mother’s fight with cancer, Riley personally hand-picks all teas and accessories,
                sourcing from trusted farms in Japan, Korea, and China for authenticity and sustainability. From matcha
                whisks to coffee grinders, every item sparks wellness and focus.</p>
